# Resume-Optimization-Using-Vector-Embeddings-and-Phidata
This project enhances resume relevance by using vector embeddings to capture the contextual meaning of words. Unlike TF-IDF, this approach understands word semantics, improving job-resume matching. Phidata is used to extract and store embeddings, while OpenAI suggests content enhancements, maximizing visibility to recruiters.
