# Resume-Optimization-Using-Vector-Embeddings-and-Phidata
Resumate is a Python-based tool that helps tailor resumes to specific job descriptions by identifying missing keywords and suggesting improvements using OpenAI's GPT model. It extracts text from a resume PDF, analyzes keyword relevance, and provides recommendations for enhancement.

### Features
âœ… Extracts resume text from a PDF file.  <br />
âœ… Compares resume content with a given job description.  <br />
âœ… Identifies missing keywords using TF-IDF vectorization.  <br />
âœ… Uses OpenAI GPT to suggest improvements and generate a tailored resume.  <br />
âœ… Plans to integrate vector embeddings for more accurate semantic matching.  <br />

### Planned Enhancements
ðŸš€ Replace TF-IDF with OpenAI's text embeddings for better semantic matching.<br />
ðŸš€ Support for multiple resume formats (DOCX, TXT).<br />
ðŸš€ UI using streamlit/gradio<br />
