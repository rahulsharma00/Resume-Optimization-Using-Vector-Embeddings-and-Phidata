# Resume-Optimization-Using-Vector-Embeddings-and-Phidata
This project enhances resume relevance by using vector embeddings to capture the contextual meaning of words. Unlike TF-IDF, this approach understands word semantics, improving job-resume matching. Phidata is used to extract and store embeddings, while OpenAI suggests content enhancements, maximizing visibility to recruiters.

### Features
âœ… Extracts resume text from a PDF file.  <br />
âœ… Compares resume content with a given job description.  <br />
âœ… Identifies missing keywords using TF-IDF vectorization.  <br />
âœ… Uses OpenAI GPT to suggest improvements and generate a tailored resume.  <br />
âœ… Plans to integrate vector embeddings for more accurate semantic matching.  <br />

### Planned Enhancements
ðŸš€ Replace TF-IDF with OpenAI's text embeddings for better semantic matching.<br />
ðŸš€ Support for multiple resume formats (DOCX, TXT).<br />
ðŸš€ UI using streamlit/gradio<br />

### Requirements 
To install these dependencies, run:
